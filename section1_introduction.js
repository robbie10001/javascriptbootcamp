JS, ECMA, TC39: WHAT DO THEY MEAN? 
ECMA script is a specification for a programming language. Its a document that describes how a language should work. 
It is then up to the browser to implement these rules as Javascript. 
TC39, is a technical committee that is in charge of maintaining and evolving the ECMAscript specifications.
ES6  took almost 6 years to release. Many features were ready sooner but had to wait for the main release. After this, they decided to release changes yearly. 
 
caniuse.com - is a good website to see if a feature of ECMAscript we are using is available in a given browser. 
While there is no an offical javascript we use, a good place o et information is 
MDN! - This is a really good resource for Javascript developers.
