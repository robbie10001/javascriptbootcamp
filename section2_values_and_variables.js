/*
GOAL OF THIS SECTION 
- Work with primitive types. 
- Understand let and const
- Use String Template Literals. 
- Work with common operators/methods 
*/


/*
PRIMITIVE TYPES 
- number 
- string 
- boolean
- null
- undefined 

We technically have two more 
- Symbol 
- BigInt 
*/

/*
INTRODUCTING NUMBERS
- JavaScript has ONE Number Type (number)
- It works with positive numbers, negative numbers, whole numbers (integers) and decimal numbers (floats)

*/

/* 
SIMPLE OPERATIONS 
- Addition 50 + 5
- Subtraction 90 - 1 
- Multiplication 11111 * 7
- Division 400 / 25 
- Modulo 27 % 2  = 1 (the remainder operator- takes the second operator and divides it by the first, and gives you the remander. )
- Exponential 2 ** 3 (2 x 2 x 2), 5 ** 5 (5 x 5 x 5 x 5 x 5 )
- NaN  is a special value in JavaScript and is a number in JS. NaN is a value that means this is not standard math, of JS is going to have hard time representing this value.
- Infinity can be shown in JS as can -Infinity 


- With Maths the regular order of operations applies.
