/*
GOAL OF THIS SECTION 
- Work with primitive types. 
- Understand let and const
- Use String Template Literals. 
- Work with common operators/methods 
*/


/*
PRIMITIVE TYPES 
- number 
- string 
- boolean
- null
- undefined 

We technically have two more 
- Symbol 
- BigInt 
*/

/*
INTRODUCTING NUMBERS
- JavaScript has ONE Number Type (number)
- It works with positive numbers, negative numbers, whole numbers (integers) and decimal numbers (floats)

*/

/* 
SIMPLE OPERATIONS 
- Addition 50 + 5
- Subtraction 90 - 1 
- Multiplication 11111 * 7
- Division 400 / 25 
- Modulo 27 % 2  = 1 (the remainder operator- takes the second operator and divides it by the first, and gives you the remander. )
- Exponential 2 ** 3 (2 x 2 x 2), 5 ** 5 (5 x 5 x 5 x 5 x 5 )
- NaN  is a special value in JavaScript and is a number in JS. NaN is a value that means this is not standard math, of JS is going to have hard time representing this value.
- Infinity can be shown in JS as can -Infinity 


- With Maths the regular order of operations applies. 
*/

/*
Variables and Let
- Variables are like labeled jars for a value in JS. 
- We can store a value and give it a name, so that we can recall it, use it, or change it later on. 

let someName = value; 

if i wanted to give my father's age. 

let fatherAge = 70; 

UPDATING VARIABLES  

let hens = 4; 
//a raccon kills a hen 
hens = hens - 1; 
//this changes the value of hens too 3.

NAMING VARIABLES 

There are certain words that we cannot use in JS, especially keywords. 
We should make our variable names make sense
We also name our variables using camel case. 
This means that we capitalise the first letter of each new word. 
For example, 
let numOfHens = 6; 
*/

/*
UNARY OPERATORS 
Instead of doing something like hens = hens + 1;
We could do this in a faster way. 
For example,
hens -= 1, this is the same as the logner method.
We can do this using other mathematical operators.

Another method we can use, which can be useful when we are using a counter for example, 
We can use a unary operator! 
For example, 
let counter = 0; 
counter++; 
this would make counter equal 1.
