/*
GOALS FOR THIS SECTION
Write Valid Functions
Write functions with arguments 
compare function expressions and function statements 
write a bunch of functions!

/*
OUR FIRST FUNCTION 

Functions are really important in order to be a Javascript developer. 
Functions are very important to JavaScripts identity as a language. 
There are lots of things we can do with functions that are really cool. 
Writing functions are not difficult, but there are lots of things to understand about the features of functions.

Functions are resuable procedures. It's a bunch of code that we wrap up in a function.
It a bunch of lines of code that we can call again at any point. We can refer back to it. 
We could have a function called getlatestredditpost, and everytime we called the function would request new reddit post and send them back to us. 
Or we could have a function that gives us the average value from within an array.
Functions allow us to wrtie resuable, modular code. 
We define a chunk of code that we can then excute at a later point.
We us them ALL THE TIME!

There is a two step process for every functin that we ever write.
1. DEFINE - we tell JavaScript this is how it works 
2. RUN- We execute the function and run it! 

We have used Methods before, and methods are functions! 
 
For example, 

"hello".toUpperCase(); 
Is a build in function, it's already defined for us and we just use it! 

Defining a function 

function functionName () {
    do something
};
*/
//all this function does is print out the three console logs below. 
//every time we call call a function these statements will be printed out. 
function grumpus() {
    console.log("You again");
    console.log("for the last time!");
    console.log('leave me alone!');
}
//in order to run the function, we have to call the function. 
grumpus();//you again, for the last time, leave me alone! 
//in order to run the code we need () parenthesis 
//we can loop through our functions 

for (let i = 0; i >3; i++) {
    console.log(grumpus());
}
