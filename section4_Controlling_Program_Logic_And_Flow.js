COMPARISON OPERATORS.

> greater than
> less than
>= greater than or equal to 
<= less than or equal to 
== equality 
!= not equal
=== strict equality 
!== stict non-equality 
*/ 
/*
DOUBLE EQUALS == 

== (equality operator)

the equality operator checks for equality of value, but not equality of type.
It coerces both values to the same type and then compares them. 
This can lead to some unexpected results!
*/ 
/*
TRIPLE EQUALS ===

=== (strict equality operator)

Checks for EQUALITY of VALUE AND TYPE! 
It is more precise and specific than the equality operator.
FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF TIME, WE SHOULD USE TRIPLE EQUALS! 

*/ 
/*
NON EQUALITY (!=) AND NON-STRICT EQUALITY (!==)

For the same reason we use the strict equality operator,
we should use the strict non-equality operator (!==)
